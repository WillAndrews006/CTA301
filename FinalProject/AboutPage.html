					My name is Will Andrews and I am a Student at Illinois State University. I am Studying Arts Technology with a minor in Computer Science and Geology.
					I first found my self interested in the arts through music.
					<br><br>
					I took piano lessons at a young age, and started to create my own melodies whenever I could.
					I started writing poetry in middle and high school and have since turned that into creating lyrics for songs. When I was introduced to Digital Audio Workstations,
					it was everything I had ever dreamed about. By creating music that I love, I hope to be able to impact others and create something for myself.
